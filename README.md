Code Louisville Front-End Wed 2021

For now, this project documents my bicycling activities for anyone who is interested in watching. This is for the purpose of satisfying requirements of the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development class. But if may evolve beyond this in the future.

Just re-pushed my work from the local repository. Things got weird because I'm not accustomed to version control.

I am implementing a hide/show items button on rides.html and an email submission form on contact.html. I figure to have the entered email quoted back to the visitor in a message confirming receipt of the address. Also, a verification to ensure they actually entered a valid address.
