Code Louisville Front-End Web 2021

"47 years of age. I've been riding bicycles since I was a child.
I fell out of it for several years then got back into it. I discovered I love it more than I ever imagined!

So, I created this site. The main impetus was that I needed a project for my Code Louisville - Front End Web Development class.
Cycling was the only thing I could think of to work with. So, here it is!

I plan for this site to showcase my riding gear and my rides (I take a GoPro on almost every ride.
Sometimes, two (one front and one rear))."



Addressing the requirements from Code Louisville, I have implemented two media queries at 600px and 992px.
For now, these address the arrangement of the Nav area. All but "Gear" work.
I have not yet implemented the Gear page.

I have also included a Show/Hide button on the "Rides" page.
No rides are actually linked in yet but placeholders are in place and behave propertly.

Finally, an email submission form for joining my mailing list.
It pops up an alert message for an incorrectly formatted submission (or no submission at all).
It also displays a success message in the html quoting the submitted address back to the user.

Thank you for your consideration! I look forward to participating in another session!
